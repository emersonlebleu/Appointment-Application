# Appointment-Application
A moc Java Desktop application for appointment management.

# Description:
A desktop application designed to keep track of business appointments, contacts, and customers. Users can create appointments and customers. Simple reports can be generated from the data. The application is sensitive to the time zone of the user's computer and will update the appointments accordingly when pulled from the database and displayed to the user. The application contains a rudimentary login, input validation, and notifications.

# Tech Stack:
Java, IntelliJ, MySQL, Maven, & Scene Builder

# Lessons:
The most interesting challenge for me with this project was learning and navigating time zone conversions. The database stores the appointments in UTC and appointments are converted, coming and going, into the appropriate time zone given the user's computer time zone.

This project allowed me to get experience building a DAO model project without a framework's assistance. Additionally, the project uses Object Oriented programming concepts and fully available JavaDocs.
